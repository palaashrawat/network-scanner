internal port scanner

This is a project I worked on at one of my internships. 

This is a piece of code that aims to perform regular network and port scanning across the firm's network, to determine active hosts and their open ports. This script should be run daily/weekly, and outputs compared to determine the diff and identify any critical or unexpected changes to the network.
